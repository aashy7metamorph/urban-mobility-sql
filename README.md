SQL queries and analysis on Hubway dataset
# 🚴 SQL Trip Analysis  

Analyze urban trip data with SQL directly inside Jupyter.  
This project explores patterns in how people travel, return, and move between municipalities.

## 📂 What’s Inside  
- `urban-mobility.ipynb` → Notebook with all SQL queries and results  
- `data/` → Raw dataset (`.csv`) for analysis  
- `README.md` → Project overview

## 🔍 What i  Did  
Using SQL queries on trip and station data, we explored:  
- Which stations see the **highest round-trips**  
- How many trips cross between **different municipalities**  
- Which **bike gets used the most**  
- Which **age groups ride the most**  
- The **top travel flows** between municipalities  and much more

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Certain stations dominate round-trips → clear hubs of activity  
- Cross-municipality rides show strong regional connectivity  
- A handful of bikes carry the bulk of the workload  
- Young to middle-aged groups make up the majority of registered riders  
- A few start–end municipality pairs explain a huge chunk of all travel
